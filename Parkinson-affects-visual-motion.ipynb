This reveals which areas are more correlated to others from the observations of EEG data. The outcomes, which will be further detailed below, revealed that some areas have higher node degree than others during the motor-visual stimulation, suggesting their greater role in visual processing of motion."

        "Parkinson, on the other hand, is a condition affecting directly the motor behaviour of an individual. The disease mainly affects the basal ganglia, leading to the death of neurons. This region connects significantly not only to the motor circuit (which executes the movements) but also to the oculo-motor and associative circuits (related to the perception of the environment). Hence, it is expected that the Parkinson condition significantly changes the Functional Connectivity Matrix and this be a component behind difficulties in walking."

        "Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a treatment consisting of implanting an electrode in a target in the thalamus, globus pallidus or subthalamic nucleous, able to provide pulses of current, with adjustable intensity and frequency. For given threshold values, specific for each individual, the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease disappear or are controlled. An intriguing question is what happens to the processing of visual motion when the DBS is on and off. Is there a constrast in the Functional Connectivity Matrix when the DBS is on or off? "
